Hello!

My name is Qing Huang, though I prefer to go by Jim. I am currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree in Mechanical Engineering at Duke University in Durham, NC, with an expected graduation date of May 2025. My academic journey began at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) in Worcester, MA, where I earned a Bachelor's degree in Robotics Engineering.

As the sixth engineer in my family, engineering is not just a profession for me, but a proud tradition. Throughout my studies at WPI, my focus was primarily on Robotics and Mechanics, encompassing both hardware and software domains. I thrive in addressing complex challenges and view every problem as an opportunity to innovate and grow.

At Duke University, my focus in Robotics and Control. I am extensively involved in advanced control systems, delving into both theoretical and practical applications. Additionally, I am leading the formation of our F1 Tenth team, a project that blends competitive racing with innovative research in autonomous vehicles. This endeavor is not just about competition; it's a platform for real-world application and advancement in robotics.

I invite you to explore my "Projects" section for a detailed overview of my hands-on experience and technical projects. Should you have any questions or wish to discuss potential opportunities, please do not hesitate to reach out.
