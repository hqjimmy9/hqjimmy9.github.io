HelloÔºÅ

My name is Qing Huang, prefer Jim.

I am currently a Master's student major in Mechanical Engineering at Duke University in Durham, NC, expecting graduate with a M.S. in May 2025. I got my bachelor's degree in Robotics Engineering from Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) in Worcester, MA.

As the sixth engineer in my family, I am deeply proud to be an engineer. During my study at WPI, I focus on Robotics and Mechanics. I do hardware and software, and I am happy with solving related issues. I always treat trouble as my friend on my journey. Please check my project experience in "Projects" and feel free to reach out with any questions.
