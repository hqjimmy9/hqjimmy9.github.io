I am currently a junior majoring in Computer Science at [Worcester Polytechnic Institute](https://www.wpi.edu/) (WPI).
I am a research assistant at [VISLab@WPI](https://zhang-vislab.github.io/) under the supervision of [Prof. Ziming Zhang](https://www.wpi.edu/people/faculty/zzhang15).
I am also working as a research student at [Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (Harvard Medical School Teaching Hospital)](https://www.bidmc.org/), advised by [Prof. Feng Tian](https://www.fengtianlab.com/).
Previously, I have worked at [Robotic Materials Group](https://wp.wpi.edu/roboticmaterialsgroup/) at WPI under the supervision of [Prof. Markus Nemitz](https://www.wpi.edu/people/faculty/mnemitz) and at [Learning Sciences & Technologies center](https://www.wpi.edu/academics/departments/learning-sciences-technologies) with [Prof. Jacob R. Whitehill](https://www.wpi.edu/people/faculty/jrwhitehill). 


My research focuses on the application and optimization of machine learning algorithms. 
My recent works have been on employing machine learning technechnics to facilitate neurological research, additive manufacturing process, and youth education. I'm currently focusing on optimizing machine learning algorithms using diffusion probalistic models.
